# Time-Based Competition Awards
- This Python script calculates the total time of a time-based competition consisting of swimming, cycling, and running events. Based on the total time, it determines the   
 level of award achieved in the competition.

# Usage
- Make sure you have Python installed on your system.
- Clone the repository or download the competition_awards.py file to your local machine.
- Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where the competition_awards.py file is located.
- Run the script using the command python competition_awards.py.
- Follow the prompts to enter the total time for swimming, cycling, and running events in minutes.
- The script will calculate the total time and display the level of award achieved in the competition.

# Requirements
- Python 3.x

# How It Works
- The script prompts the user to enter the total time for swimming, cycling, and running events in minutes.
- It calculates the total time by summing the individual event times.
- Based on the total time, the script determines the level of award achieved in the competition using the following criteria:
  * If the total time is less than 100 minutes, it prints "Provincial colours" indicating the highest level of award.
  * If the total time is between 100 and 105 minutes (inclusive), it prints "Provincial Half colours" indicating a slightly lower level of award.
  * If the total time is between 105 and 110 minutes (inclusive), it prints "Provincial scroll" indicating a further lower level of award.
  * If the total time is greater than 110 minutes, it prints "No award" indicating that the competition was completed after the qualifying time.
